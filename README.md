# helloworld
There is the place where i store quick codes, ideas, links and snippets that i used or will use in the future.


About me and this strange place:

  Hello stranger! When you are standing near me, you can listen the story about my masterfull and glorious program developer career.. No, you're not. I am just a noob :) 
  But i hope this repository will help me to organize all my thoughts and ideas while I am making my awkward steps as a java/js/python/css/html dev!

Also, i am creating an excel VBA scripts due my work, but i can't commit those, because of condfidental info it contains. :(
